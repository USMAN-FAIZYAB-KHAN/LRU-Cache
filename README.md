## 📜 Overview

This project combines a Python-based backend with a graphical user interface to showcase the functionality of an LRU Cache. It includes the ability to:
- Define cache size dynamically.
- Add key-value pairs to the cache.
- Retrieve values using keys, with real-time miss rate tracking.
- Visualize cache updates and data flow.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Cache Size Adjustment**: Customize the cache size using a slider.
- **Cache Visualization**: See real-time updates of the cache content.
- **Miss Rate Calculation**: Get instant feedback on cache performance.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface to interact with the LRU Cache.
